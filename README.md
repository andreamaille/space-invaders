# space-attack

Built this space invaders inspired game for my Beyond Bootcamp: JavaScript Fundamentals Class. Assignment was to build something using vanilla JS only. This was my first time building a game and I had a lot of fun learning and putting this together!


I must give credit to the following resources that helped me immensely in the learning process. These resources are also noted in the JS file. Thought it would be helpful to list them here as well if anyone else is learning game development!
